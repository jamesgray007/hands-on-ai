What is the evidence that this belief is not 100% true?\\n\\nIs there another angle or perspective you take that flips this belief on its head and empowers you?\\n\\n\\n\\n✅ Step 8: Rituals - describe small rituals you will commit to, behaviors you will let go of, and mindsets you will adopt to reinforce this new self-affirming belief.\\n\\nConfidence grows when you set an intention and deliver on it. \\n\\nSometimes, the hardest part is just starting something new.\\n\\nIdentify a small habit or ritual you can invest in to strengthen the power of the new belief.\\n\\n\\n\\n✅ Step 9: Outcomes - describe the positive changes and outcomes you expect by reframing this belief. Think about the signs of progress.\\n\\nIdentify the small signs of progress, and how when multiplied over time it will support your vision.\\n\\n\\n\\nJames Gray SLB Examples\\n\\nThere are a few SLBs from December 2022 after my CIO job was eliminated.\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\nSLB: Millions of coaches have a lot more experience than me, and comparatively, I have less to offer and cannot thrive financially doing the work I love.\\n\\n\\n\\nBelief Origin: I think this is just a fear of doing something new and bold, resulting from so many years of working for money without a true purpose.\\n\\n\\n\\nWarning Signs: When I see coaches running successful, profitable, well-established businesses.\\n\\n\\n\\nNegative Consequences: I will limit my potential by not intentionally pursuing this.\\n\\n\\n\\nEmotions: Worry, stress, anxiety, invisibility, comparison, insecurity\\n\\n\\n\\nThe role I played: I may show up less confident than I should be. I don’t go all in and protect myself from failure.\\n\\n\\n\\nSelf-Affirming Beliefs to Neutralize this SLB:\\n\\nI believe that my fusion of deep experience in data, AI, leadership coaching, and expertise as a university instructor is a unique value proposition that people will choose me as their coach.\\n\\nI believe that continuous learning and adapting to the changing environment are essential to remaining relevant and prospering.\\n\\n\\n\\nRituals to reinforce SABs:\"\n",

I want to work with leading companies that can leverage my expertise without requiring a full-time commitment.\\n\\n\\n\\nPositive Outcomes:\\n\\nI will feel more free to work with multiple organizations in a consulting capacity than tethered to one as a full-time employee. I will validate my unique expertise, which the market values.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Identity: Data & AI Leader\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t© James Gray Innovations LLC | All rights reserved. | www.jamesgray.io\"\n",
